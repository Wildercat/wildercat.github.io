                <p><b>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</b></p>
                <p>The first week wasn't too surprising for me. Meeting on the first day was interesting, 
                    it was strange to be in a classroom or school-like environment with much older students (including me)
                    than the last time I was in school.
                </p>
                <p><b>What are you struggling with?</b></p>
                <p>Well, for the this assignment in particular I managed to tunnel on one slide
                    and forget to check the others for assignments. I have also missed a standup purely due
                    to my own negligence. These types of logistical struggles are common for me, so I will just need to
                    stay on full alert for the duration of the prework. Once the in-person work begins, I expect to have less 
                    problems in that area.
                </p>
                <p><b>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</b></p>
                <p>I'm excited to get more into javascript, node, react, etc. The logical elements behind
                    webpages are way more interesting to me than the visual ones.
