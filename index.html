                <p><b>What did you learn about that helped you understand more about Design?</b></p>
                <p>
                    The talk on CRAP design principles was enlightening. One of my takeaways was the importance of
                    whitespace.
                </p>
                <p><b>What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand Design better?</b></p>
                <p>Learning and talking about graphic design was fun, but I would love to learn more about design in
                    general, not just specifically graphic design.
                </p>
                <p><b>What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?</b></p>
                <p>
                    I appreciate the concepts of Design that were talked about this week for how practical they were -
                    they really took into account the actual purpose of what's being designed. I guess
                    the most critical aspect of design to me is to keep the main thing the main thing.

                <p><b>What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in Prework?</b></p>
                <p>
                    I'm not too sure which topics you're referring to, but if its HTML/CSS/Javascript: <br>
                    I liked understanding more of the interaction between HTML and CSS. I still don't like the actual
                    design
                    process, involving adding css
                    and then visually checking the page, changing the css again, etc. <br>
                    I really enjoyed working with javascript. Writing code that's simple and does the job is extremely
                    satisfying. I didn't dislike anything about it.
                    Though I am told that once I learn other languages I will have things to complain about with
                    javascript.
                </p>
                <p><b>What was helpful? </b></p>
                <p>Justin and Ian were quite helpful! When I asked a question on slack, they responded within the
                    minute.
                </p>
                <p><b>What hindered your progress?</b></p>
                <p>I can't think of anything external that really hindered me. Wow classic, perhaps.</p>
                <p><b>How did you overcome challenges?</b></p>
                <p>Blind persistence.</p>

                <p>
                    Hmm, that reads an awful lot like a test question... The answer that you're probably looking for is
                    that
                    HTML provides the structure for a web page, CSS makes it
                    readable for humans, and Javascript makes it interactive.

                <p><b>What are your thoughts on Pseudo Coding?</b></p>
                <p>
                    I enjoyed writing the pseudocode. The line between pseudocode and actual code was not clear to me -
                    something
                    like a for loop seemed like a specific feature of specific languages, so I wasn't sure if that was
                    something I
                    could use in pseudocode.

                <p><b>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</b></p>
                <p>The first week wasn't too surprising for me. Meeting on the first day was interesting,
                    it was strange to be in a classroom or school-like environment with much older students (including
                    me)
                    than the last time I was in school.
                </p>
                <p><b>What are you struggling with?</b></p>
                <p>Well, for the this assignment in particular I managed to tunnel on one slide
                    and forget to check the others for assignments. I have also missed a standup purely due
                    to my own negligence. These types of logistical struggles are common for me, so I will just need to
                    stay on full alert for the duration of the prework. Once the in-person work begins, I expect to have
                    less problems in that area.
                </p>
                <p><b>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</b></p>
                <p>I'm excited to get more into javascript, node, react, etc. The logical elements behind
                    webpages are way more interesting to me than the visual ones.
