                <p><b>What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in Prework?</b></p>
                <p>
                    I'm not too sure which topics you're referring to, but if its HTML/CSS/Javascript: <br>
                    I liked understanding more of the interaction between HTML and CSS. I still don't like the actual design process, involving adding css 
                    and then visually checking the page, changing the css again, etc. <br>
                    I really enjoyed working with javascript. Writing code that's simple and does the job is extremely satisfying. I didn't dislike anything about it.
                    Though I am told that once I learn other languages I will have things to complain about with javascript.
                </p>
                <p><b>What was helpful? </b></p>
                <p>Justin and Ian were quite helpful! When I asked a question on slack, they responded within the minute.</p>
                <p><b>What hindered your progress?</b></p>
                <p>I can't think of anything external that really hindered me. Wow classic, perhaps.</p>
                <p><b>How did you overcome challenges?</b></p>
                <p>Blind persistence.</p>

                <h2>Week Three Questions</h2>
                <p class="date">September 9th, 2019</p>
                </div>
                <p><b>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and Javascript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</b></p>
                <p>
                    Hmm, that reads an awful lot like a test question... The answer that you're probably looking for is that HTML provides the structure for a web page, CSS makes it 
                    readable for humans, and Javascript makes it interactive.

                <h2>Week Two Questions</h2>
                <p class="date">September 4th, 2019</p>
                </div>
                <p><b>What are your thoughts on Pseudo Coding?</b></p>
                <p>
                    I enjoyed writing the pseudocode. The line between pseudocode and actual code was not clear to me - something
                    like a for loop seemed like a specific feature of specific languages, so I wasn't sure if that was something I 
                    could use in pseudocode.
                </p>
                <p><b>What are you struggling with?</b></p>
                <p>I am not struggling with anything, particularly.</p>
                <p><b>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</b></p>
                <p>I'm still excited about getting into javascript, and server-side web development.</p>

                    <h2>First Post</h2>
                    <p class="date">August 30th, 2019</p>
                </div>
                <p><b>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</b></p>
                <p>The first week wasn't too surprising for me. Meeting on the first day was interesting, 
                    it was strange to be in a classroom or school-like environment with much older students (including me)
                    than the last time I was in school.
                </p>
                <p><b>What are you struggling with?</b></p>
                <p>Well, for the this assignment in particular I managed to tunnel on one slide
                    and forget to check the others for assignments. I have also missed a standup purely due
                    to my own negligence. These types of logistical struggles are common for me, so I will just need to
                    stay on full alert for the duration of the prework. Once the in-person work begins, I expect to have less 
                    problems in that area.
                </p>
                <p><b>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</b></p>
                <p>I'm excited to get more into javascript, node, react, etc. The logical elements behind
                    webpages are way more interesting to me than the visual ones.
