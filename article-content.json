Meeting on the first day was interesting, it was strange to be in a classroom or school-like environment with much older students (including me) than the last time I was in school.</p><p><b>What are you struggling with?</b></p><p>Well, for the this assignment in particular I managed to tunnel on one slide and forget to check the others for assignments. I have also missed a standup purely due to my own negligence. These types of logistical struggles are common for me, so I will just need to stay on full alert for the duration of the prework. Once the in-person work begins, I expect to have less problems in that area.</p><p><b>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</b></p><p>I'm excited to get more into javascript, node, react, etc. The logical elements behind webpages are way more interesting to me than the visual ones.</p>"

The line between pseudocode and actual code was not clear to me - something like a for loop seemed like a specific feature of specific languages, so I wasn't sure if that was something I could use in pseudocode. </p> <p><b>What are you struggling with?</b></p> <p>I am not struggling with anything, particularly.</p> <p><b>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</b></p> <p>I'm still excited about getting into javascript, and server-side web development.</p>"

The answer that you're probably looking for is that HTML provides the structure for a web page, CSS makes it readable for humans, and Javascript makes it interactive. </p>"

I still don't like the actual design process, involving adding css and then visually checking the page, changing the css again, etc. <br> I really enjoyed working with javascript. Writing code that's simple and does the job is extremely satisfying. I didn't dislike anything about it. Though I am told that once I learn other languages I will have things to complain about with javascript. </p> <p><b>What was helpful? </b></p> <p>Justin and Ian were quite helpful! When I asked a question on slack, they responded within the minute. </p> <p><b>What hindered your progress?</b></p> <p>I can't think of anything external that really hindered me. Wow classic, perhaps.</p> <p><b>How did you overcome challenges?</b></p> <p>Blind persistence.</p>"

One of my takeaways was the importance of whitespace. </p> <p><b>What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand Design better?</b></p> <p>Learning and talking about graphic design was fun, but I would love to learn more about design in general, not just specifically graphic design. </p> <p><b>What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?</b></p> <p> I appreciate the concepts of Design that were talked about this week for how practical they were - they really took into account the actual purpose of what's being designed. I guess the most critical aspect of design to me is to keep the main thing the main thing. </p>"
